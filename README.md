# 📊 [Prompt Compression and Query Optimization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/prompt-compression-and-query-optimization/)

🔍 Welcome to the "Prompt Compression and Query Optimization" course! Instructed by Richmond Alake, Developer Advocate at MongoDB, this course will equip you with the skills to optimize the performance and cost-efficiency of large-scale Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications by integrating traditional database features with vector search capabilities.

## Course Summary
In this course, you'll learn to optimize large-scale RAG applications by integrating vector search capabilities with traditional database operations. Here’s what you can expect to learn and experience:

1. 📋 **Prefiltering and Postfiltering**: Filter results based on specific conditions. Prefiltering is done at the database index creation stage, while postfiltering is applied after the vector search is performed.
2. 📊 **Projection**: Select a subset of fields returned from a query to minimize the size of the output, enhancing performance and security.
3. 🔄 **Reranking**: Reorder search results based on other data fields to improve the relevance and quality of information retrieval.
4. ✂️ **Prompt Compression**: Reduce the length of prompts, which can be expensive to process in large-scale applications, optimizing both performance and cost.

## Key Points
- 🌐 **Vector Search and Database Operations**: Combine vector search capabilities with traditional database operations to build efficient and cost-effective RAG applications.
- 🚀 **Optimized Query Processing**: Use prefiltering, postfiltering, and projection techniques for faster query processing and optimized query output.
- 💡 **Prompt Compression**: Implement prompt compression techniques to reduce the length of prompts, making them more efficient to process in large-scale applications.
